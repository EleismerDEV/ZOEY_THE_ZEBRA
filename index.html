## ⚡ Week 2 Automation Template

To streamline future quizzes:
1. **Create a folder structure in the repo:**
   ```
   /week1/index.html
   /week2/index.html
   /week3/index.html
   ...
   ```
2. Keep one **main dashboard (`index.html`)** at root with links:
   ```html
   <ul>
     <li><a href="/week1/index.html">Week 1 – Taylor Swift Era ✨</a></li>
     <li><a href="/week2/index.html">Week 2 – K-Pop Demon Hunters ⚔️</a></li>
     <li><a href="/week3/index.html">Week 3 – Labubu Forest 🌲</a></li>
   </ul>
   ```
3. For each new week:
   - Drop in the generated `index.html` inside `/weekX/`.
   - Add a link to the root dashboard.

This way, GitHub Pages auto-publishes **all weeks in one site** — no need to create separate repos.

---

✅ Benefits:
- One-click publishing (just upload the new week’s file).
- Central dashboard to navigate between weeks.
- Consistent UX, data tracking, and CSV downloads across all weeks.
